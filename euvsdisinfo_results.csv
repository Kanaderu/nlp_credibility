"Blaming China for COVID-19 is a ploy, like blaming Russia for MH17",https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/blaming-china-for-covid-19-is-a-ploy-like-blaming-russia-for-mh17/,01.04.2020,Journal of New Eastern Outlook,"EU, Russia, Ukraine, US, The Netherlands, Syria","The assumption that China created COVID 19 is based on an important research paper written in 2015 that tied a research facility in Wuhan to a study on a bat virus that created something capable of infecting the world, a disease exactly like COVID 19.
This is the origin of the “blame China” ploy, just like the blame Russia for fake gas attacks in Syria or when the Kiev regime shot down MH17.
All that was needed was a fake court, fake evidence and controlled media.","Conspiracy theory with no evidence given; a straw man argument, attacking an imaginary position of the opponent. No serious sources suggest China ""created"" the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused the COVID-19 outbreak.
A recent analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found no evidence that it was developed artificially in a lab or otherwise engineered. The virus comes from a family of viruses originating in animals that includes others such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China in late 2019 and has been rapidly spreading across the world.
The claim that ""Russia is blamed for fake gas attacks"" ostensibly refers to the war in Syria and is another example of the straw man argument. Russia has never been accused of using chemical weapons during its military involvement in Syria; however, Russia has supported the Assad regime, which has used toxic gas against opposition strongholds.
The international investigation into the downing of flight MH17, which killed all 298 people onboard, has concluded that the perpetrators who fired the Russian-made BUK TELAR missile that shot down the plane were connected to Russian armed forces units. The ongoing trial in Amsterdam will evaluate the evidence produced by the investigation. Pro-Kremlin media have been aggressively attempting to question the legitimacy of the investigation and the Dutch judiciary. Examples of cases on MH17 can be found here.
This case is another example of how the pro-Kremlin disinformation machine exploits crisis situations like the current COVID-19 pandemic to spread disinformation about other topics and opportunistically adapts existing pro-Kremlin narratives to new contexts.","Disinfo: Blaming China for COVID-19 is a ploy, like blaming Russia for MH17",https://journal-neo.org/2020/03/31/covid-and-the-terror-of-uncertainty/,Journal of New Eastern Outlook,Issue190,01/04/2020,English,"EU, Russia, Ukraine, US, The Netherlands, Syria","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Chemical weapons/attack, Syrian War, Russophobia, Bashar al-Assad, MH17"

""Let me assure you: for someone like myself, for whom freedom of travel and movement were hard-won rights, such restrictions can only be justified when they are absolutely necessary. In a democracy, they should not be enacted lightly – and only ever temporarily. But at the moment they are essential — in order to save human lives.""

Consistent with earlier pro-Kremlin disinformation message that the Schengen zone has collapsed and more broadly, with the disinformation narrative that the EU is collapsing as a result of the coronavirus crisis.
The Schengen border code provides Member States with the capability of temporarily reintroducing border control at the internal borders in the event that a serious threat to public policy or internal security has been established:
Where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security, these countries may exceptionally reintroduce border controls at its internal borders for a period of no more than 30 days (possible to prolong under conditions established by the code) or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat. This action should be seen as a last resort. If such controls are to be reintroduced, the other EU countries that are part of the Schengen area and the European Commission must be notified without delay with a view to possible consultations. The European Parliament and the Council must be informed at the same time.
The European Union is supporting Member States in addressing the crisis and has adopted measure to mitigate the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
To cushion the blow to people’s livelihoods and the economy, the European Commission has adopted a comprehensive economic response to the outbreak, applied the full flexibility of the EU fiscal rules, has revised its State Aid rules and proposed to set up a EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative to provide liquidity to small businesses and the health care sector.
To support scientific research into COVID-19, the European Commission earmarked 47.5 million EUR for shortlisted research projects that can improve epidemiology and public health, including preparedness and response to outbreaks. The EU has also created first ever stockpile of medical equipment.

The article’s claim that societies which aren't concerned about government abuses are better at preventing and controlling epidemics do not reflect reality. Authoritarian regimes or closed societies, which tend to control and manipulate information and limit the freedom of doctors and scientists to engage in international cooperation, are often an obstacle to the timely detection and containment of epidemic outbreaks.
A clear example is China’s deliberate cover-up in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. The regime suppressed information about the virus and allowed it to spread unchecked in the crucial early days and weeks. The Chinese government censored and detained those doctors and whistleblowers who attempted to sound the alarm and warn their fellow citizens when they understood the gravity of the coronavirus threat.
Furthermore, the real antidote to the COVID-19 pandemic (and to future epidemic outbreaks) is not to revert to nationalist isolationism and “closed societies” but to develop a global response. A coordinated, cross-border effort of the scientific and medical community to understand the virus, create cures and treatments, and speedily disseminate a vaccine across national borders, will bring the global pandemic under control.

Hogan was leaving the country, the US Embassy published the following statement on its Facebook page: ""The United States Embassy in Chisinau continues to operate. Ambassador Dereck J.

In this case the evidence is not necessary, but it is sufficient to put a “highly confidential” stamp and refer to high-level sources.

Here is a summary of the main disinformation messages Russian media (including official media) has been spreading about the coronavirus:
• Messages targeting domestic Russian audiences describe the virus as a form of foreign aggression, for instance claiming that the coronavirus originates in secret US or Western laboratories and emphasising that challenges coping with the virus mainly affect foreign and democratic countries, while Russia is fighting the outbreak
• Messages targeting international audiences (in English, Italian, Spanish and Arabic, among other languages) follow a different approach: they focus primarily on conspiracy theories about “global elites” deliberately weaponising or exploiting the virus for their own ends. Here the aim is to induce distrust in national and European authorities and healthcare systems, international institutions, and scientific experts, among others.
• Narratives describing the virus as man-made is present in disinformation targeting all audiences.",Disinfo: EU is not publishing the coronavirus disinformation cases it accuses Russia of spreading,,,Issue 189,22/03/2020,Arabic,"Russia, US","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Biological weapons, European Union"

To support scientific research into the COVID-19, the European Commission has earmarked 47,5 million EUR for shortlisted research projects that can improve epidemiology and public health, including preparedness and response to outbreaks. The EU has also created first ever stockpile of medical equipment. 
EU Member States are also helping each other in this crisis, for example German hospitals offering to treat critical coronavirus patients from France as well as taking in patients from Italy, and the Czech Republic sending masks to Italy.

The article provides no evidence to support its apocalyptic claims about the imminent collapse of global order and the breakdown of globalisation. The COVID-19 pandemic is halting travel and commerce across the globe. Its spread will slow the global economy which is heavily dependent on international production and global supply chains. While the pandemic is a challenge for globalization, it will not bring the end to this long-term process. Globalisation has brought significant benefits for billions of people, and most of the world will not be eager to do away with these benefits and with the free movement of people, goods and capital.
COVID-19, as well as future pandemics, can only be countered by means of international cooperation.  A coordinated, cross-border effort to monitor and treat the disease, and to speedily develop and disseminate a vaccine across national borders, will end the pandemic.

Also necessary is an autoritarian state that exerts rigid centralised control over society, and a self-sufficient economic system.

Authoritarian regimes, which tend to control and manipulate information and to limit the freedom of doctors and scientists to engage in international cooperation, are often an obstacle to the timely detection and containment of epidemic outbreaks.
A clear example is China’s deliberate cover-up of the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. The regime suppressed information about the virus and allowed it to spread unchecked in the crucial early days and weeks. The Chinese government censored and detained those doctors and whistleblowers who attempted to sound the alarm and warn their fellow citizens when they understood the gravity of the coronavirus threat.
Furthermore, the real antidote to the coronavirus pandemic (and to future epidemic outbreaks) is not to revert to nationalist isolationism and “closed societies” but to develop a global response.

It also pushes a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that sanctions against Russia are senseless and ineffective.
In fact, the sanctions from the US and the EU (including Germany) do not aim to punish Russia or the Russian people but were introduced to send a clear signal to the Russian government after Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, deployment of armed formations in eastern Ukraine, and the downing of the Malaysian passenger plane MH17.
The first round of EU sanctions against Russia was introduced on 17 March 2014. Later, in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in eastern Ukraine, the EU imposed economic sanctions in July 2014 and reinforced them in September 2014. The latest decision on a six-month extension of EU sanctions against Russia was taken in December 2019, to last until 31 July 2020. The false narrative about sanctions being unproductive is often backed by false statistics. For example, the alleged economic growth of two percent does not withstand scrutiny. In 2018, the inflation rate went up and the rouble depreciated 20% against the dollar.

The smallpox vaccine, on the other hand, was successfully developed and introduced in 1796. It is even known that smallpox ravaged several countries, including Russia, during the early part of the 20th century and was even worse during the misery that accompanied and followed the First World War.
With the establishment of the USSR in 1917, the new government took steps to control smallpox, and vaccination was made mandatory in a decree signed by V.I. Lenin in April 1919, and in 1924, the Soviet vaccination law was modified to require vaccination in infancy and the revaccination of teenagers (Kravchenko, 1970).

Another open secret is that the current hysteria over the outbreak is being successfully used by some players to achieve their own economic and geopolitical goals. Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally.","This is a conspiracy theory, presented with no evidence to support the claim that the coronavirus crisis is being intentionally exploited for economic and geopolitical goals.
This is a continuation of pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts about the coronavirus outbreak, aiming to put blame on the West for allegedly exploiting the outbreak for their own purposes, namely isolating China. While many baseless conspiracy theories have emerged all around the world amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no evidence that Western media are deliberately promoting them with malign intent. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that pro-Kremlin media are spreading disinformation on the disease for political purposes through a coordinated campaign.
The mortality rate of the coronavirus has varied by country and estimates differ, however, it is more deadly than most strains of the flu. Since it is a new disease, humans do not have any immunity to it. The rapid spread of the virus around the world threatens to overwhelm public health systems, particularly in poorer countries, resulting in more deaths and other adverse societal and economic impacts. In a statement on 5 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation drove home the gravity of the situation, saying: ""this epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor.

This is a conspiracy theory about the coronavirus, and one of many recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives aiming to undermine the results of the MH17 investigation and the outcomes of the future trial.
The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation.
On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing is scheduled for 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands.
The European Union and NATO have called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT’s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are formally holding Russia accountable.

Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, told FactCheck.org that the patent has nothing to do with the new 2019-nCoV virus.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention explains that the name of new coronavirus comes from the crown, or corona-like appearance of infective viruses when seen under a microscope.

Siti Fadilah claimed that there were ""mistranslated phrases that don't match the Indonesian version"", and therefore the book needed to be retracted.",Disinfo: The new coronavirus is a US biological weapon,,,Issue 181,23/01/2020,"Arabic, Russian","China, US","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Virus / bacteria threat, Biological weapons"
A new Chinese coronavirus was likely elaborated in NATO biolabs,https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/a-new-chinese-coronavirus-was-likely-elaborated-in-nato-biolabs/,22.01.2020,"Sputnik Belarus @ Novosti Shiolkovogo Puti time 1:00 - 1:17, 2:25 - 3:18, 5:08 - 5:28","China, US","A new coronavirus coincides with a number of significant events in the world, including the WEF’s Davos Forum in Switzerland. It must not be a coincidence, just as it was with H1N1 virus and others. This is all business aimed at the creation of specific political and economic situation. There are many American and NATO biological laboratories around China. They study human saliva, the genome of humans representing specific race. Japanese media write that the new virus infects only Chinese.
Global fights are not ethical, everything can be used. Back into 1950-1960s, China released posters saying: “Everyone to struggle with American bacteriological aggression!”, this is coming back. Soon the new coronavirus will be linked to ecology… They will say that the presence of European specialists at Chinese industrial enterprises is needed in order for the Chinese goods to be exported to the US and Europe.","This is a conspiracy theory aimed to cast a shadow at the US / NATO as likely purposeful creators of the new virus pursuing political and economic aims. So far nothing suggests that this was the case. Coronaviruses are well known to science. They are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, rarely evolving and spreading from animals to humans.
In a new study in the Journal of Medical Virology, researchers sequenced the genes of 2019-nCoV (as the new coronavirus is now called) and suggested that 2019-nCoV likely originated in snakes. Hence the likeliest version so far is that the virus began to spread from Wuhan's local seafood and animal market.",Disinfo: A new Chinese coronavirus was likely elaborated in NATO biolabs,,,Issue 181,22/01/2020,Russian,"China, US","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Virus / bacteria threat, EU, NATO"

Open source data indicates that over 80,000 people froze in the US so far during this winter. However, this might not be a national catastrophe for them, because they do not treat people living on the streets as equal citizens.","This statistic is fake and cannot be backed up with available data. No mass cases of people freezing to death in the US during this winter have been reported. Last winter, at least 21 people died in one of the worst cold snaps to hit the US Midwest in decades.
Read earlier cases of fake statistics alleging that the EU countries’ economies are on the brink of default, with over 20% unemployment rates, that in Chile, 10 kilograms of bread costs as much as an average monthly salary, and that 20,000 armed migrants are getting ready to break into the EU.","Disinfo: Over 80,000 people froze to death in the US during this winter",,,Issue 181,22/01/2020,Russian,US,fake statistics
